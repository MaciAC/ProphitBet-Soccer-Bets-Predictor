    <h1>Importance plots</h1>
    Use "Importance Weights" method to train a classification model and plot its importance
    scores for each feature (column). <br>
    "Variance Analysis to plot variance scores for each feature." Features with very low variances have little
    predictive power, since the expected value of that feature is always similar. <br>
    Univariate test are statistical tests, which assign an
    importance score to each feature.  <br> Finally, feature elimination process is a
    process on which a model is trained multiple times, each time removing a
    feature. The importance scores are computed by the model's accuracy at
    each iteration. <br> <br>
